				<h3>Philosophy</h3>
			</div>
            <p class="mb-2">It is our aim "to create architecture that is conceptual, enduring and modernistic" - to explore originality - an inno- vative, intuitive response - resulting in an unique & topical yet practical design every time - an Architecture that is flamboyant & exuberant - an icon to look up to.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Each design solution is ingenious in pursuing its main interest - to address and adapt itself to the particular set of parameters that juxtapose its creation.</p>
            <p>On a more practical note it is a design that is organized around a simple, resonant concept; there's an overall idea that serves as the projects purpose. It is a tight balancing act between complex constraining factors viz. Land Avail- ability, Finance, Infrastructure, Social Commitments etc. Optimum use of resources, Floor Space Index / Floor Area Ratio, a balance - a synergy between Form and Function- to generate an Aesthetic built form a design solution that transforms and exceeds expectation.</p>
