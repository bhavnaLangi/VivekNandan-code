            <h6>Methodology</h6>
            <p class="mb-2">Exposure to international standards of planning and design and the multi-faceted designing capabilities of the firm gives us the requisite skills, temperament and the professional outlook to undertake and execute projects. The bulk of the projects are Residential
                Buildings/Complexes, Commercial Projects, Malls etc.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">We believe architectural design is a response to a long and specific set of circumstances, and each time the slate is thrillingly blank. Given that, we never approach a project with a pre-conceived solution, or a signature "style." What we have, instead, is a process for to get to the essence of a project, with every stakeholder involved onboard.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">It begins with doing our homework, thoroughly and well. Defining goals, articulating benchmarks, budgeting, prioritizing, listening... These sessions are a fascinating process of discovery because our clients do fascinating things. They challenge themselves, and, in their own fields, reach beyond what's expected.</p>

            <p> We believe, too, in creating an atmosphere in which people are willing to risk exploring ideas. In our view, design is everybody's business. (It is, after all, something we live with, walk through, or peer out of everyday.) So we seek to set the stage for a lively creative exchange. It's part of our philosophy:
                Before a design can be drawn, it must be drawn out
            </p>

            <h6>Philosophy</h6>
            <p class="mb-2">It is our aim "to create architecture that is conceptual, enduring and modernistic" - to explore originality - an inno- vative, intuitive response - resulting in an unique & topical yet practical design every time - an Architecture that is flamboyant & exuberant - an icon to look up to.</p>

            <p class="mb-2">Each design solution is ingenious in pursuing its main interest - to address and adapt itself to the particular set of parameters that juxtapose its creation.</p>

            <p>On a more practical note it is a design that is organized around a simple, resonant concept; there's an overall idea that serves as the projects purpose. It is a tight balancing act between complex constraining factors viz. Land Avail- ability, Finance, Infrastructure, Social Commitments etc. Optimum use of resources, Floor Space Index / Floor Area Ratio, a balance - a synergy between Form and Function- to generate an Aesthetic built form a design solution that transforms and exceeds expectation.</p>
