                <h3>Methodology</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="mb-2">Exposure to international standards of planning and design and the multi-faceted designing capabilities of the firm gives us the requisite skills, temperament and the professional outlook to undertake and execute projects. The bulk of the projects are Residential
            Buildings/Complexes, Commercial Projects, Malls etc.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">We believe architectural design is a response to a long and specific set of circumstances, and each time the slate is thrillingly blank. Given that, we never approach a project with a pre-conceived solution, or a signature "style." What we have, instead, is a process for to get to the essence of a project, with every stakeholder involved onboard.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">It begins with doing our homework, thoroughly and well. Defining goals, articulating benchmarks, budgeting, prioritizing, listening... These sessions are a fascinating process of discovery because our clients do fascinating things. They challenge themselves, and, in their own fields, reach beyond what's expected.</p>
            <p> We believe, too, in creating an atmosphere in which people are willing to risk exploring ideas. In our view, design is everybody's business. (It is, after all, something we live with, walk through, or peer out of everyday.) So we seek to set the stage for a lively creative exchange. It's part of our philosophy:
                Before a design can be drawn, it must be drawn out
